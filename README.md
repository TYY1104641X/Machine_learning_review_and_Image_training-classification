Review notes of machine learning algorithms

I state that the review lecture notes are shared online.
The lecuture notes (with some screen shots) are summarized from multiple resources listed in corresponding files. 
Please feel free to let me delete the corresponding files if they infringe your copyrights.

Note that most of the codes are based on shared resources. Please visit links in the corresponding files to look for source codes.


The informal lecture notes consist of most of the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, including learning regression, logistic regression, 
SVM, GDA, KNN Decision tree, K-means, NN, and CNN.
